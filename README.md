# F-P_Hexagon

So the main reason for doing this Feature Project is to do a little research on how to get the hexagonal shape into unity by making custom meshes in unity using only code. Later I can then use this knowledge in other games/ projects. Searching the web for useful information on how to make custom meshes and how to render those into unity.

## Features
A feature that stands out to me is how easy it is to make custom meshes and to get them to render in-game.

- [How to store the corners of the mesh](https://github.com/DragstylerNL/Hexagons/blob/master/Hexagon/Assets/_Scripts/HexMetrics.cs)
- [The Spawning in of the mesh's HexMetrics](https://github.com/DragstylerNL/Hexagons/blob/master/Hexagon/Assets/_Scripts/HexMesh.cs)

## Software Analysis
For this project I made use of the Unity Engine because this was one of the requirements for this project. Next to this, I wanted to know how to do this in Unity so I can use it in other Unity projects of mine.

## Learning-goals
- Understanding how to make and how to implement custom meshes using nothing but some code.
- Creating a grid using the Hexagons and working with their offset and sizes from all angles.
